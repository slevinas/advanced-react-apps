# Advanced React Apps:

Each React-App(mini project) has it's own dedicated branch if you'd like to explore or check out the code for specific react-app eg. the-react-quiz. Just append /tree/<branchName> to the end of the GitHub URL to access a specific branch directly.
 For example, to get to the branch for the-react-quiz we'd go to:
  https://github.com/slevinas/advanced-react-apps/tree/the-react-quiz
